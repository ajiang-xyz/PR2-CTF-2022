Bonus FQ!!

This forensics question is probably unlike anything you've ever seen before. This is a rather challenging CTF-style challenge and your goal is to extract a single flag in the format 'FLAG{FLAG_TEXT_HERE}' without the quotes. Note: the entirety of the flag is uppercased, and all characters in the flag -- excluding the curly braces and underscores -- are in the English alphabet (so the flag has no numbers or anything fishy)

Since it's pretty hard and there are 3 distinct steps involved in solving the challenge, I'll give you a hint to get started on the first two steps: try getting an image out of the zip file somehow and then maybe research image steganography a bit

After that, good luck! Oh, and to make things a bit spicier, if you're the first person to message me on Discord and send the entire flag, an explanation of how you solved the challenge, and a score report screenshot of a full score on the image, you'll be the most goated CTFer in our class and you'll immediately get the opportunity to present this weeks Windows image!

Good luck, don't die, and have fun!!
